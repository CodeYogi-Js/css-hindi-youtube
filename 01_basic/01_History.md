# History of CSS

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is used to style and design web pages (colors, layout, fonts, spacing, responsiveness, etc.).

In the early days of the web, styling was done directly inside HTML using tags like `<font>`, `<center>`, etc. This made websites messy and hard to maintain.

To solve this problem, **CSS was created to separate content (HTML) from design (CSS).**

## 👨‍💻 Inventor of CSS

CSS was invented by **Håkon Wium Lie** in **1994**.

He proposed the idea while working at **CERN**, the same place where the web was invented.

Later, he worked with **Bert Bos** to develop CSS further.

CSS was standardized by **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**.
